Multi-skilled creative with expertise in graphic design, audio production, and administrative support. My curiosity for technology and creativity started early and has grown into a passion for building meaningful digital projects.

I specialize in visual branding & design, crafting digital and print assets, and enhancing audio projects through editing, mixing, and mastering. Alongside the creative side, I also provide reliable administrative support to keep projects organized and efficient.

Passionate about innovation and continuous growth, I enjoy transforming ideas into polished outputs that inspire and connect.
